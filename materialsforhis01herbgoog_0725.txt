The present collection of Monas‘tic Annals embraces all the more important
chronieles compiled in religione houses in England during the thirteenth
century. These distinct vorke are ten in number. The extreme period
which they embracc ranges from the year 1 to 1432, although they refer more
especially to the reigns of J ohn, Henry 111„ and Edward 1. Some of these narra-
tives have already appeared in print, but others are printed for the first time.

This work contains a number of very curione and interesting incidente, and
being the work of a contemporary, is very valuable, not only as a truthful
biography os a celebrated ecclesiastic, but as the work of a man, who, from per·
sonal knowledge, gives notices of passing events, as vell as of individuale who
were then taking active· part in public affairs. The author, in all probability,
was Adam Abbot of Evesham. He was domestic chaplain and private confessor
of Bishop Hugh, and in these capacities was admitted to the closest intimacy.
Bishop Hugh was Prior of Witham sor 11 years before he became Bishop of
Lincoln. His consecration took place on the 2lst September 1186 ; he died on
the 16111 of November 1200 ς and was canonized in 1220.

The authorship of the Chronicle in Vol. 1.‚ hitherto ascribed to Geoffrey
vineunt, is now more correctly ascribed, to Richard‚ Canon of the Boly Trinity
of London. The narrative extends from 1187 to 11993 but its chief interest
consiste in the minute and authentic narrative which it furnisheu of the exploits
of Richard 1., from his departure from England in December 1189 to his death
in 1199. The author states in his prologue that he was an eye-witness of much
that he records ς and varioue incidental circumstances which occur in the course

of the narrative confirm this assertion.
The letters in Vol. Π., written between 1187 and 1199, are of velue as

furnishing authentic materials for the history of the ecclesiastical condition of
England during the reign of Richard Ι. They had their origin in a dispute which
arose from the attempts of Baldwiu and Hubert, archbishops of Canterbnry, to
found a college of secular canons, a projeet which gave great umbi-age to tbe
monks of Canterbnry, who sav in it a design to supplent them in their sanction
os metropolitan chapter. These letters are printed, for the first time, from a MS.
belonging to the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth.
