The volumes known as the ‘⁴ Year Books” contain reports in Nomen-French
os cases argued and decided in the Com-ts of Common Law. They may be con-
sidered to a great extent as the “lex non scripta ’' of England, and have been held
in the highest veneration by the ancient seges of the law, and were received by
them'as the repositories of the first recorded judgments and dicta of the great
legal luminat-ies of past ages. They are also worthy of the attention of the
general reader on account of the historica] information and the notices os public

aud private persons which they coucam, as well as the light which they throw

on ancient manners and eustoms.

This volume contains the narrative of an eye-witness who details with eon·
siderable power and minuteness the circumstances which attended the final ex-
pulsion of the English from Normandy in the year 1450. The history commences
with the infringement of the truce by the capture of Fougisres. and ends with
the battle of Formigny and the embarkation of the Duke of Somerset. Thc

spondant de la Societe des Antiquaires de Normandie. 1863-1867.

This work consists of two parta, the History and the Cartulary of the Monastery
of St. Peter, Gloueester. The history furnishes an account of the monastery
from its foundation, iu the year 681, to the early part of the reign pf Richard 11..
together with a calendar of donations and benefactione. It treats principally of
the affairs of the monastery, but occasionally matters of general history are
introduced. Its authorship has generally been assigned to Walter Froucester‚
the twentieth abbot, but without any foundation.

Esq„ M.A. 1863.

Neokam was a. man who devoted himself to soicnce‚ such as it was in the
twelt'th century. In the “De Naturis Rerum” are to be found what may bc
called the rudimenta of many scienees mixed up with much error and ignorance.
'Neokam was not thought infalliffle, even by his contemporaries, sor Roget Bacon
remarks of him, “ this Alexander in many things wrote what vas true and useful ε
⁶· but he neither ean nor ought by just title to be reckoned among authorities.’'
Neokam, however, had sufficient independenee of thought to differ srom some
of the schoolmen who iu his time considered themselves the only judges of litera·
ture. He had his own views in morals, and in giving us a glimpse of them, as
well as of his other opinions, he throws much light upon the manners, customs.
and general tone of thought prevalent in the twelsth century. The poem entitled
‘⁴ De Laudibus Divinae Sapientiae ’⁹ appears to be a meu-icat paraphrase or
abridgment of the “ De Naturis Rerum.” It is written in the elegiae mette,
and though there are many lines which violate classical rules, it is, as a whole,

above the ordinary standard of medioeval Latin.

and edited by the Rev. T. OSWALD CochYmt, M.A., of St. John’s

College, Cambridge. 1864-1866.
This work illustrates not only the history of scienee‚ but the history of super.

stition. In addition to the information bearing directly upon the medical skill
,md medical faith of the times, there are many passages which incidentally throw
light upon the general mode of life and ordinary diet. The volumes are interest ing
not only in their scientific, but also in their social aspect. The manuscripts from
which they have been printed are valuable to the Anglo-Saxon scholar sor the

illustratione they afford of Anglo·Saxon orthography.
