This curicus chroniclc extends from the fabulous period of history down to the
return of Edward IV. to England in the year 1471 after the second deposition of
chry VI. The manuscript from which the text of the work is taken is pre-
served in the Immrial Library at Paris, and is believed to be the only complete
and nearly contemporary copy in existence. The work, as originally bound,
was comprised in six volumes‚ since rebound in morocco in la volumes‚ folio
maximo, vellum, and is illustrated with exquisite miniatures, vignettes, and initial
letters. It was written towards the end of the fifteenth century, having been
expressly executed for Louis de Bruges, Seigneur de la Gruthuyse and Earl of
winchester, from whose cabinet it passed into the library of Louis ΧΠ. at Blois.

This is one of the many mediaeval chronicles which assume the character of a
history of the world. It begins with the creation, and is brought down to the
author's own time, the reign of Edward 111. Prefixed to the historica-l portion, is
a chapter devoted to geography, in which is given a description of every known
land. 'l'o say that the Polychronicon was written in the fourteenth century is to
say that it is not free from inaccuracies. It has, however, a value apart from ite
intrinsic merits. It enables us to form a very fair estimate of the knowledge of
history and geography which well-informed readers of the fourteenth and fifteen th
centuries possessed, for it was then the standard work on general history.

The two English mnslations, which are printed with the original Latin, afford

interesting illustrations of the gradual change os our langnage, for one was made
in the fourteenth century, the other in the fiftecnth. The differences between

Trevisa's version and that of the unknown writer are often considerable.

'These two treatises, though they cannot rank as independent narratives, are
nevertheless valuable as careful absa-acts of previous historiam, especially ‘⁴ Le
Livere de Reis de Engletere.” Some various readings are given which are
interesting to the philologist as instances of semi-Saxomsed French.

Itis supposed that Peter of Ickham must have been the author, but no certain

conclusion on that point has been arrived at.

The Abbey of Meanx was a cistercien house, and the work of its abbot is both
curicus and valuable. It is a faithful and osten minute record of the establishment
of a religione community, of its progress in forming an ample revenue, of its
struggles to maintain its acquisitione, and of its relations to the governing
institutione of the country. In addition to the private affairs of the monastery,
some light is thrown upon the public events of the time, which are however kept
distinct, and appear at the end of the history of each abbot’s administration. The
text has been printed from what is said to be the autogrsph of the original
compiler‚ Thomas de Burton, the nineteenth abbot.

The exact date at which this work was written is, according to the chronicler,
1250. The history is of considerable value as an illustration of the period during
which the author lived, aud contains a good summary of the events which followed
the Conquest. This minor chronicle is, however, based on another work (also
written -by Matthew Paris) giving fuller details, which has been called the
‘⁴ Historia Maiorss’ The chronicle here published‚ nevcrtheless, gives some

information not to be found in the greater history.
