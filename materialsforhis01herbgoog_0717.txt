, the church 01· westminster. Nothing is known of the author. The second' is
an anonymous poem, containing 536 lines, written between 1440 and 1450, by
command of Henry VL, to whom it is dedicated. It does not throv any
new light on the reign o’f Edward the Confessor, but ιε valuable as a specimen
of the Latin poeti-y οι· the time. The third, also by an anonymous author, was

Τ110 first volume contains original materials for the history of the settlement
01· the order 01 Saint Francis in England, the letters of Adam de Matisco, and
other papers connected with the foundation and diffusiori of this great body. It
was the aim 01· the editor to collect whatever historical information could be
found' 10 this country, towards illustr-ating a period of the national history for
which onlv scanty materials exist. None 01 these have been before printed.
The second volume contains materiale found, since the first volume was
published‚ among the MSS. 01· Sir Chai-les Isham, and 10 various librar-ies.

This work derives its principal valae from being the only contemporaneous
account 01· the rise of the Lollards. When written the disputes 01· the school-
men had been extended to the field of theology, and they appear both in the
writings of Wyeliff and in those of his adversaries. Wycliff’s little bundles
of tares are not less metaphysical than theological, and the conflict between
N ominalists and Rcalists rages side by side with the conflict between the different
interpretem of Scripture. The work gives a good idea 01· the controversies at
the end 01· the 14111 and the beginning 01· the 15th centur-ies.

This is a metrical translation of a Latin Prose Chronicle, and was written in the
first 11011 01· the 16111 century. The narrative begins with the earliest legends
and ends with the death 01· James Ι. 01· Scotland, and the“ evil ending 01· the
traitors 11101 slew him.” Strict accuracy of statement· is not to be looked sor ιιι
such a work as this ς bnt the stories 01· 1110 001001001100 01· Spain, Ireland‚ and
Sootland are interesting 11 not trne; and the chronicle is valnable as a reflection
of the manners, sentiments, and character 01· 1110 age in which it was composed.
The peculiarities of the Scottish disiectare well illustrated 10 this metrical version,
and the student 01· language will find ample materiale for compar-ison with the
English dialects 01· the same period, and with modern lovland Scotch.
