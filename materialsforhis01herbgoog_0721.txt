The Topographia Hibernica (in Vol. V.) is the result of Giraldus' two visits to
Ireland. The first in the year 1183, the second in 1185-6, when he accompanied
Prince John into that country. Curious as this treatise is, Mr. Dimock is of
opinion that it ought not to be accepted as sober truthful history, for Giraldua
himself states that truth was not his main object, and that he compiled the work
for the purpose of sounding the praises of.Henry the Second. Elsewhere, how·
ever. he declares that he had stated nothing in the Topographia of the truth οἱ
which he was not well assured, either by his own eyesight or by the testimony,
with all diligenee elicited‚ of the most trustworthy and authentic men in the
country ; that though he did not put just the same full saith in their reporta as
in what he had himself seen, yet, as they only related what they had themselves
seen, he could not bnt believe such credibie witnesses. A very interesting portion
ofthis treatise is devoted to the animale of lrelnnd. It shows that he was a very
accurate and acute observet, and his descriptione are given in a way that a
scientific naturalist ot* the present day could hardly improve upon. The Expug-
natio Hibernica was written about the year 1188 and may be regarded rather
aa a. great epic than a sober relation ot· acts occurring in his own days, No
one ean pei-use it without coming to the conclusion that it is rather a poeticnl
fiction than a prosaic truthful history.·

Vol. VI. contains the Itinernrium Kambrim et Descriptio Kambriae: and

This Chronicle, extending from the earliest history of Britain to the year

1154, is justly the boast of England; for no other nation can produce any history,

written in its own vernacular, at all approaching it, either in antiquity‚ truthful-

ness‚ or extent, the historical books of the Bible alone excepted. There are at

present six independent manuscripts of the Saxon Chronicle, ending in different

years, and written in different parts of the country. In this edition, the text

of each manuscript is printed in columns on the same page, so that the student

may see at a glauce the various changes which occur in orthography, whether

. arising from locality or age.
