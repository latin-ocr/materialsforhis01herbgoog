Altbough this Chronicle tells of the arrival of Hengist and Horsa in England
in the year 449, yet it substantially begins vith the reign of King Alfred, and
comes down to the year 1292, where it ends abruptly. The history is particu-
larly valuable sor notices of events in the eastern portione os the kingdom,
which are not to be elsewhere obtained, and some curicus facts are mentioned
relative to the floods in that part of England, which are confirmed in the Fries-
land Chronicle of Anthony Heinrich, pastor of the Island of Mohr.

Μ.Αο 1353? 1.)ξὲΞέ hre perhaps the most interesting of all the historical writings of

the period, though they cannot be relied on for accuracy of statement. They
are various in character ς some are upon religione subjecte, some may be called
satires, and some give no more than a court sundal, but as a whole they pre-
sent a very fair picture of society, and of the relations of the different classes
to one another. The period compl-ised is in itself interesting, and brings us,
through the decline of the feudal system, to the beginning of our medem
history. The songs in old English are of considerable value to the philologist. .

The author, a monk of Norwich‚ has here given us a Chronicle of England
from the arrival of the Saxons in 449 to the year 1298, in or about which year
it appears that he died. The latter portion of this history (the whole of the

reign ot* Edward 1. more especially) is of great value, as the writer vas con-
temporary with the events vhich he recorda. An Appendix contains several

illustrative documents connected with the previous narrative.
