ALEXANDER PAPA AD ROGERIUM EBORACENSEM ARCHI-
EPISCOPUhLa

(o. iii. 103 A. 2305 z. iv. 453 Thom. 245.)

Quanto per carissimum filium nostrum Henricum,
illustrem Anglorum regem, ampliora incrementa et
commoda in hujus necessitatis articulo ecclesiae Dei
provenisse noscuntur, et quanto nos eum pro suae
devotionis constantia majori affectione diligimus, et
cariorem in nostris visceribus retinemus, tanto ad ea
quae ad honorem, incrementum et exaltationem ipsius
et suorum cognoscimus pertinere libentius et promptius

⁸ There has been much contro-
versy about this letter, which is not
in the vatican MS.; but the doubts
suggested by its absence there
seem to be overpowered by the
authority of other MSS. lt is,
however, usually found without a
date; and, as it has been com-
monly referred to the beginning of
1170, about which time letters of
an opposite tendency were written
by the pope to others, questions as
to his supposed inconsistency have
entered largely into the arguments

on the genuineness of this letter.
(See Lyttelton, Hist. of Henfy 11.,
ii. 5403 Milman, Lat.,Christianity,
iii. 511, ed. 1; and against the
letter, Berington’s Hem-y 11„ 606-
8 ; ungara, ii. 153, ed. 18493
Pauli, iii. 80.) But if the date
given by Bohmer be correct, the
letter was really written while the
pope was in the extremity of dis·
tress from the siege of Rome by
the emperor. J aff& admits it as
genuine. See further, Reuter, ii.
683-4.
