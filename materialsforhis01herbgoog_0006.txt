ΟΝ the 26th of J anuary 1857, the Mastcr of the Rolls

submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materials for the History os this Country from the

Invasion οἱ· the Romans to the reign of IIenry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scarce and valuable.

'He proposed that each chronicle or historieal docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the most correct text should bc formed
from an accurate collation ot* the best MSS.

'I'o render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology ; but
no other note or comment was to be allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness of

the text. 2
