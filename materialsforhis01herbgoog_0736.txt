This important and unique survey of the greater portion of Englaud* is the
oldest aud most valuable record in the natioual archives. It was commenced
about the year 1084 and finished in 1086. Its compilation was determined upon
at Gloucester by William the conqueror, in council, in order that he might
know what was due to him, in the way of tax, from his subiects, and that each
at the same time might know what he had to pay. It was compiled as much
for their protection as for the benefit of the sovereign. The nobility and people
had been grievously distressed at the time by the king bringing over large num·
bers of French and Bretons‚ and quartering them on his subJects, ‘⁶ each accord-
“ ing to the measure of his land,”for the purpose οἰ resisting the invasion of
Cnut, King of Denmark, which was apprehended. The commissionem appointed
to make the surrey were to inquire the name of each place 3 who held it in the
time of King Edward the Confessor3 the present possessor3 how many hides
were in the manor 3 how many ploughs were in demesne 3 how many homagers 3
'how many villeins 3 how many cottam how many serving men3 how many free
tenants 3 how many tenants in socc-age 3 how much wood, meadow, and pastui-e 3
the number of milis and fish-ponds 3 what had been added or taken away from
the place 3 what was the gross ralue in the time of Edward the Confessor 3 the
present value3 and how much each free-man or soc-man had, and whether any
advance could be made in the value. Thus could be ascertained who held the
estate in the time of Kinae Edwardg who then held it 3 its value in the time of
the late king3 and its vidue as it stood at the formation 01 the survey. So
minute vas the surrey, that the writer of the contemporary portion of the Saxon
ChronicIe recor-ds, with some asperity—“ So very narrowa he caused it to be
“ traced out, that there was 11οι a single hide, nor one virgate of land, nor even,
“ it is shame to tell, though it seemed to him no shame to dc, an ox, nor a conv,
‘⁸ nor a swine vas left, that was not set down.’'
