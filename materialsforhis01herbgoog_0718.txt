7. Jonanms Car-ea ,νε Lmnn nn unvammans Hmzmcls· Edited by the
Rev. F. C. Hmsnswm M.A., of Exeter college, Orford. 1858.

This work is dedicated to Hem-y VI. of England, who appears to have been, in
the author's estimation‚ the greatest of all the Henries. It is divided into three
parts, ‘each having a separate dedication. The first part relates only to the history
of the Empire‚ from the election of Henry 1., the Fowler‚ to the end of the
reign of the Emperor Henry VI. The second part is devoted to English
history, from the accession of Henry Ι. in 1100, to 1446, which was the twenty·
fourth year of the reign of Hem-y Vl. The third part contains the lives of
illustrious men who have borne the name of Ilenry in various parts of the world.
Capgrave was born in 1393, in the reign of Richard 11.. and lived during the
Wars of the Rosea, for which period his work is of some valne.

been the character of thework when completed. The only copy known is in the

usque ad Annum Domini 1366; a Monacho quodam Malmesbiriensi
ἳξεέιέὶιίιέῐὲὲ Vols. Ϊ., Π., and III. Edited by F. S. Hunos, Esq.. B.A.

This is a Latin Chronicle extending from the Creation to the latter part of the
reign of Edward 111„ and written by a monk of the Abbey of malmesbur-y. ir.
Wiltshire, about the year 1367. A continuation, carrying the history of England
down to the year 14 13, was added in the former half of the fifteenth century b}
an author whose name is not known. The original Chronicle is divided into
five books. and contains a history of the world generally, but more especially
of England to the year 1366. The continuation extends the history down to
the coronation of Henry V. The Eulogium itself is chiefly valuable as contain-
ing a history, by a contemporary, of the period between 1356 and 1366. The
notices of events appear to have been written very soon aster their occurrence
Among other interesting matter, the Chronicle contains a diary of the Poitiers
campaign, evidently furnished by some person who accompanied the army of the- ”2Q1
Black Prince. The continuation 01 the Chronicle is also the work of a contern- ᾗ
porary, and gives a very interesting account of the reigns of Richard ΙΙ. and
Henry IV. It is believed to be the earliest authority for the statement that the
latter monarch died in the Jerusalem Chamber at westminster. ’
