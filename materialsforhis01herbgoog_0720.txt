This volume, like all the others in the series containing a miscellaneous scleco
tion 01· letters, is valuable on account 01· the light it throws upon biographical
history, and the familiar view it presents of characters, manners, and events.
The period requires much elucidatiom to which it will materially contribute.

The ‘⁴ Repressor '’ may be considered the earliest piece of good theological dis·
quisition of which our English prose literature can boast. The author was born
about the end 01· the som-teenth century, consecrated Bishop of St. Asaph in
the year 1444, and translated to the see of chichester in 1450. while Bishop of
St. Asaph, he zealously defended his brother prelates from the attacks of those
who censui-ed the bishops for their neglect of duty. He maintained that it was no
part of a bishop’s functione to appear in the pulpit, and that his time might be
more profitably spent, and his dignity better maintained, in the performance 01
vorke 01· a higher character. Among those who thought differently vere the
Lunares, and against their general doctrines the ‘⁶ Repressor ’⁹ is directed. Pecock
took up a position midway between that of the Roman Chureh and that of the
modern Anglican Church; but his work is interesting chiefly because it gives a
full account of the views of the Lollards and 01· the arguments by which they were
supported, and because it assists us to ascertain the state of feeling which ulti·
mately led to the Reformation. Apart from religione matters, the light throvn upon
contemporaneous history is very small, but the “ Repressor’' has great value
for the philologist, as it tells us what vere the characteristica 01· the language in
use among the cultivated Englishmen of the fifteenth century. Pecock, thougaeh
an opponent of the Lollards, showed a certain spirit of toleration, for which he
received, towards the end of his life, the usual medimval reward—persecution.

20. Ἠτῖιιῗθὲὅηβωε. Edited by the Rev. JORN WILLIAMS AB Imm„ ’

These annals, which are in Latin, commence in the year 447, and come down
to the year 1288. The earlier portion appears to be taken from an Itish Chronicle
which was alsov used by Tigernach, and by the compiler of the Annals 01· Ulster.
During its first century it contains scarcely anything relating to Britain, the
earliest direct concurrence with English history is relative to the mission of
Augustine. Its notices throughout, though brief, are valuable. The annale
were probably written at St. Davids, by Blegewryd, Archdeacon of Llandaff,
the most learned man in his day in all Cymru.

21. Tar: Womrs or Gmannus Causunnsm. Vols. Ι., 11., 111„ and IV.
Ediced by J. S. Bnnwmz, M.A.,Pr0sess0r of English Literature, King’s

Collega, London. Vols, V., VI.‚ and VII. Edited by the Rev. JAMES
F. Dracon, M.A., Rector of Barnburgh‚ Yorkshire. 1861-1877.

These volumes contain the historical ποι-1η 01· Gerald du Barry, who lived
in the reigns 01· Henry IL, Richard Ι., and John, and attempted to re-establish
the independence 01· Wales by restoring the see of St. Davids to its ancient
primacy. His works are 01· a very miscellaneous nature, both in prose and
verse, and are remarkable chiefly for the racy and original anecdotes which
they contain relating to contemporaries. He is the only Welsh writer of any
importance who has contributed so much to the medioeval literature of this
country, or usumed, in consequence of his nationality, so free and independent
a tone. His frequent travels in Italy, in France, in Ireland, and in Wales, gave
him opportunities for observation which did not generally fall to the lot of medioeval
writers in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and of these observations Giraldus
has made due use. Only extracta from these treatises have been printed before ,
and almost all 01· them are taken from unique manuscripts.
