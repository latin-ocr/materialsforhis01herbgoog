On 25 July 1822, the House of Commons presented an address to the
Crown, stating that the editions of the works of our ancient historiam were
inconvenient and defective 3 that many of their writings still remained in
manuscript, and, in some casce, in a single copy only. They added, ‘⁶ that an
“ uniform‘ and convenient edition of the whole, published under His Majesty's
“ royal sanction, would be an undertaking honourable to His Majesty’s reign,
“ and conducive to the advancement of historical and constitutional know-
“ ledge ; that the House therefore humbly besought His Majesty‚ that He
‘⁶ would be-graciously pleased to give such directions as His Majesty, in His
“ wisdom, might think fit, for the publication of a complete edition of the
“ ancient historiens of this realm, and assured His Majesty that whatever
“ expense might be necessary for this purpose would be made good.'’

The Master of the Rolls‚ being very desirous that effect should be given
to the-resolution of. the House of Commons, submitted to Her Majesty’s
'Pteasury in 1857 a plan for the publication of the ancient chronicles and
memoriale of the United Kingdom, and it was adopted accordingly. In
selecting these works, it was considered right, in the first instance, to
give preference to those of which the manuscripts were unique, or the
materials of which would help to fill up blanks in English history for
which no satisfactory and authentic information hitherto existed in any
accessible, form. One great object the Master of the Rolls had in view ,was
tor form a corpus historicum within reasonable limite, and which should be
as‘complete as possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was important
that the historical student should be able to select such volumes as conformed·
with his own peculiar tastes and studies, and not be put to the expense of
purchasing the whole collection3 an inconvenience inseparable from any
other plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.

Of the Chronicles and Memoriales, the following volumes have been pub·
lished. They embrace the period from the earliest time of British history
down to the end of the reign of Henry VII.

1. Tm.- Cnnomona or EuoLAun, by Jomv Car-enavit. Edited hy the

Rev. F. C. Hmensron, M.A., of Exeter College, Oxford. 1858.
Capgrave was prior of Lynn‚ in Nor-folle, and provincial of the order of the
Friars Hermits of England'shortly before the year 1464. His Chronicle extends
from the creation of the world to the year 1417. Aa a record of the language
spoken in Norfolk (being written in English), it is of considerable valae.

2. Cauomcon Monssrsnn nn Amnenox. Vols. Ι. and ΙΙ. Edited by

the Rev. ‹Josnrn S‘ravnusoiss M.A., of University college, Durham‚
and Vicat· of Leighton Buzzard. 1858.

This Chronicle traces the history of the great Benedictine monastery of
Abingdon in Berkshire, from its foundation by King Ina of Wessex, to the
reign of Richard 1., shortly after which period the present narrative vas drawn
up hy an inmate of the establishment. The author had access to the title-deeds
of the house3 and incorporates into his history various charters of the Saxon
lunge, of great importance as illustrating not only the history of the locality
but that of thc- kingdom. The work is printed for the first time.
