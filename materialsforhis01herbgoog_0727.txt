The “Book of Hyde ”is a compilation from much earlier sources which are
usually indicated with considerable care and precision. In many cases, however,
the Hyde chronicler appears to correct, to qualify, or to amplify—either from
tradition or from sources of information not now discoverable-—the statementS,
which, in substance, he adopts. He also mentions, and frequently quotes from
writers whose works are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

There is to be found, in the “Book of Hyde,'' much information relating to the
reign of King Alfred which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume
contains some cuncus specimens of Δηρὼ-81111011 and Mediaeval English.

There is, in this volume, a legendary account of the peopling of Ireland and of
the adventures which besell the various heroes who are said to have been con·
nected with Irish history. The details are, however, very meagre both for this
period and for the time when history becomes more authentic. The plan adopted
n the chronicle gives the appearance of an accuracy to which the earlier porticus
of the work cannot have any claim. The succession ofevents is nmrked, year by
year, from Am. 1599 to Am. 1150. The principal events narrated in the later
portion of the work are, the invasione οἱ remigum, and 1110 wars of the Irish
among themselves. The text has been printed from a MS. preserved in the
library of Trinity College, Dublin‚ written partly in Latin, partly in Irish.

It is probable that Pierre de Langtoft was a canon of Bridlington, in Yorkshire,
and that he lived in the reign of Edward 1.‚ and during a portion of the reign of
Edward 11. This chronicle is divided into three parts3 in the first is · an
abridgment of Geoffrey of Moumouth’s “Historia Britonum,'' in the second. a
history of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman kings, down to thedeath of Henry 111..
and in the third a history 01· the reign of Edward 1. The principal object of the
work was apparently to show the justice 01· Edward's Scottish wars. The
language is singularly corrupt, and a curicus specimen of the French of Yorkshire .

The work in its present form, in the editor’s opinion. is a comparatively modern
version os an undoubtedly ancient original. That it was compiled from contem-
porary materials has been proved by curicus incidental evidence. It is stated iu
the account given of the battle of Clontarf that the full'tide in Dnblin Bay 011 tho
day os the battle (23 April 1014) coincided with sunrise3 and that the returning
tide in the evening aided considerably in the defeat of the Danes. The fact has
been verified by astronomica} calculations, and the inference is that the author of
the 0111001010, if· not himself an eye-witness. must have derived his information
froin those who were eye-witnesseS. The contenta of the work are sufficienti)-
described in its title. The story is told after the manner of the Scandinavian
SagaS, with poems and fragments of poems introduced into the prose narrative.

This chronicle of the reigns of Henry 11. and Richard 1.. known commonly
under the name of Benedict of Peterborongh‚ is one 01· the best existing speci-
mens of a class of historical compositions of the first importance to the student.
