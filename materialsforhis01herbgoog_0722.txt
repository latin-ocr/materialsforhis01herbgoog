The object of this work is to publish notices ot all known sources of British
history, both printed and unprinted.. in one continued sequence. The materiale,
when historical (as distinguished from biographical), are arranged under the
year in which the latest event is recorded in the chronicle or history, and not
under the period in which its author, real or supposed, flourished. Biographies =
are enumerated under the year m which the person commemorated died, and not
under the year in which the life was written. This arrangement has two
advantages; the materials sor any given penod may be seen at a glance; and
if the reader knows the time when an author wrote, and the number of years
that had elapsed between the date of the events and the time the writer flourished,
he will generally be enabled to form a fair estimate of the comparative vulne of
the narrative itself. A brief analysis of each work has been added when deserving
it, in which the original portions are distinguished from those which are mere
compilations. When possible, the sources are indicated from which such com-
pilations have been derived. A biographical sketch of the author of each piece
has been added, and a brief notice has also been given of such British authors as
have written on historical subiects.
