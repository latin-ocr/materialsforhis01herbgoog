This work has long been justly celebrated, bnt not thoroughly understood until
Mr. Stubbs’ edition. The earlier portion, extending from 732 to 1148, appears
to be a copy of a compilation made in Northumbria about 1161, to which
Hoveden added little. From 1148 to 1169—a very valuable portion of this
work—the matter is derived from another source, to which Hoveden appears to
have supplied little, and not always judiciously. From 1170 to 1192 is the
portion which corresponds with the Chronicle known under the name of
Benediot of Peterborough (see No. 49); but it is not a copy, being sometimes
an abridgment, at others a paraphrase; occasionally the two works entirely
agree3 showing that both writers had aceess to the same maternus, but dealt
with them differently. From 1192 to 1201 may be said to be wholly Hereden's
work a itis extremely valuable, and an authority of the first importance.

Wxniam of Malmesbury's “Gesta Pontificum” is the principal foundation of
English Ecclesiastical Biography‚ down to the year 1122. The manuscript

author’s autograph‚ containing his latest additions and amendments.

A collection of original documents, elucidating mainly the history and condition
of the municipal, middle, and trading classes under or in relation with the
rule of England in Ireland‚—-a subject hitherto in almost total obscur-ity.
Extending over the first hundred and fifty years of the Anglo-Norma„
seulement, the series includes charters, municipe] laws and reg-ulatione, rons of
names of citizens and members of merchant-gnilds, lists of commodities with
their rateS‚ correspondence, illustrations of relations between ecclesiastics and
laity3 together with many documenta exhibiting the state of Ireland during the
presence there of the Scots under Robert and· Edward Bruee.

The original of this chronicle has passed under various names. The title of
‘⁴ Annals of Loch C6 '’ was given to it by Professor O’Curry‚ on the ground that
it was transcribed for Briau Mac Dermot, an Irish chieftain‚ who resided 01, the
island in Loch Ce, in the county of Roscommon. It adds much to the materiam
for the civil and ecclesiastical history of Ireland; and contains many <surinus

This book contains the ancient ordinances and lawe relating to the nau,
and was probably compiled for the use of the Lord High Admiral of Englan'd
Selden calls it the “ jewel of the Admiralty Record5.” Prynne ascribes to the
Black Book the same authority in the Admiralty as the Black and Red Books
have in the Com-t of Excbequer, and most English writers on man'time law

recognize its importance.
